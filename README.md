# Subtvtle

Subtvtle is an application built on the Angular framework using MongoDB. Users can alter displayed subtitles on the fly and save the edited text to a database. This project was built by the students at General Assembly Seattle WDI 11. We delegated tasks to small teams of two programmers and used version control to collaborate and design the application to spec. To run the application, download or clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Run `nodemon` to start a server and navigate to localhost:3000 to view the application.
